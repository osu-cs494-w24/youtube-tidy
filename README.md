Welcome to YouTube Tidy. The purpose of this web application is to grant a user the ability to manage their playlists, subscriptions, including in bulk.

# Responsive for mobile and desktop

This application was designed for mobile-first, and adapted to higher resolutions such as native desktop resolutions.

## Checkout the app (Oregon State faculty and students)

The web application is currently in testing. We utilized the Google Cloud Console, which requires that we validate our application before publishing into production. Without publication, only students, faculty, and manually approved users may login to the app.
